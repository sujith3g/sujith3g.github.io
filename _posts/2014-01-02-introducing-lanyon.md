title: Blogging Using Markdown and Text-editor
---

This post is about how I started blogging using my favourite text-editor and Markdown. Earlier I was using the Blogger and Wordpress. But it is very difficult to edit on WYSIWYG editor. Especially when you are adding code-snippet or commands.

Finally I got [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), which is a butler for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

### This is what I did.

Since github provides free hosting for sites developed in Jekyll as github pages at [gihub.io](http://github.io). As a first step to create github page, I just created a repo with ``` <my-github-username>.github.io ``` [here](http://github.com/sujith3g/sujith3g.github.io).

Then cloned the repo to my system, and downloaded the **Lanyon** Poole theme from [here](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/). Extracted the Lanyon files to my repo ``` ~/sujith3g.github.io/```.
Then pusghed the changes to my repo, after sometime my github page was up and running [sujith3g.github.io](http://sujith3g.github.io).

It was the default data provided by [Poole](http://getpoole.com/). After reading [this](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) tutorial for several minutes. I have changed some basic configurations like Title,Author Name,etc. And started writing this post using my Sublime-text. 

Thanks!
