title: Why we moved from Bitbucket to Github.
---

Anyone who has used or is using git, must have heard about [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/) and [Github](https://github.com/), two git repository hosting services. We were using Bitbucket for the last 2 years. But last week we switched to Github. Here is the reasons why we switched to Github:

1.    Issue Tagging

      When we start developing an application, issues can pile up. This is where the tagging feature helps. Unfortunately Bitbucket lacks this feature. But we can adjust with the  Module/Milestone feature.
Still Bitbucket won't allow us to keep one issue in more than one module/milestone. This is where Github works well, We can attach any number of tags(coloured) to an Issue.
Github also provides a very good option to cross-reference issues, pull-requests, and commits.

2.  Milestones

    Github's milestone makes sense. It has an option to set due date, move Issues to milestone. And shows the progress of the milestone graphically. Wherein Bitbucket just provides an extra column in the issue tracker.

3. Visualizations

     Github provides very nice visualisations about what is happening in our team/project. This part is completely missing in Bitbucket. It has got an activity feed which is not that useful. Github's contributions graph, streak, contributors, punchcard are all kind of motivating/gamifying. See some of the screenshots:
