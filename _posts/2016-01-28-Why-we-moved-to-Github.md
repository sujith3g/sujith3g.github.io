title: Why we moved from Bitbucket to Github.
---

Anyone using/used git must have heard about [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/) and [Github](https://github.com/). We were using Bitbucket for the last 2 years. But last week we switched to Github. Here is the reasons why we switched to Github.

1.    Issue Tagging

      When we start developing an application, Issues can pile up, this is where tagging feature helps. Unfortunately Bitbucket lacking this feature. But we can adjust with Module/Milestone feature.
But Bitbucket won't allow us to keep one issue in more than one module/milestone. This is where Github works well, We can attach any number of tags(coloured) to an Issue.

2.  Milestones

    Github's milestone makes sense, It has got an option to set due date, move Issues to milestone. And shows the progress of the milestone graphically. Wherein Bitbucket just provides an extra column in the issue tracker. No use at all.

3. Visualizations

   Github provides very nice visualisations about what is happening in our team. This part is completely missing in Bitbucket.

4. Contribution Points and Streaks
