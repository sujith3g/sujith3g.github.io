title: How to set transparent background for iTerm2 in full screen mode on a Mac
---

I was trying to set transparent background to [iTerm2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITerm2), but when I switched to full screen mode, the background was again black.

Recently, I came across the following settings in the iTerm2, which allow us to make the background transparent in full screen mode: 

 1. Open your iTerm2-> Choose `Full screen` window style in `Open profiles -> Edit profiles -> Window -> Style`settings.
 2.	 Now un-check the `Native full screen windows` in `General` settings of iTerm(not the profile).
 3.	 Now you can choose the level transparency in `Open profiles -> Edit profiles -> Window` settings.
 4.	 Now check the iTerm2 in full screen mode, You will be able to see the icons and apps in the background.

Now you can use the system-wide hotkey mentioned in `Keys` settings/Preferences of iTerm to show/hide iTerm.
